This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r}
print('Hello World')
```

```{r}
# install.packages('tidyverse')
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Exploring tidyverse
```{r}
library(dplyr) # for manipulating data
library(readr) # for getting data
library(ggplot2) # for plotting data
tips <- read_csv("tips.csv")
# You can change where this is output above in "Settings (by knit) > 	Chunk Output in Console"
tips
select(tips, -X1)
select(tips, starts_with('s'))
filter(tips, day =='Sun')

tips %>%
select(smoker, tip) %>%
mutate(gbp_tip = tip * .82) %>%
filter(gbp_tip >= 5)
```
